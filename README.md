What's next for SolarVista
- Expanding to Other Renewable Sources: In the long term, we’re looking to go beyond just solar data. We plan to integrate wind and hydro power potential into SolarVista, so the platform becomes a complete tool for renewable energy planning. This will help communities and planners choose the best energy source based on what’s most abundant in their area.
- Developing a Mobile App: We also want to make SolarVista more accessible for local communities by developing a mobile app. This would allow users to easily provide on-the-ground data, even in areas with limited internet access. It’s a way to make sure that everyone can contribute, no matter where they are.
